# Copilot Prompt: Debug `send_click.wav` Sound on Send Button Click

You are assisting me in a C#/.NET Revit add-in solution in **Visual Studio 2022**.

- Solution: **ReActionAI**
- Main projects involved:
  - `ReActionAI.Integration.Revit` (Revit add-in, WPF UI)
  - `ReActionAI.Abstractions`
  - `ReActionAI`
- Revit version: **Revit 2024**
- Target framework: **.NET Framework 4.8 (net48)**

## Goal

Fix the issue where the sound file **`send_click.wav`** does **not** play when the **Send** button is clicked in the chat panel.

When the user clicks the Send button in the UI, a short click sound from `send_click.wav` must be played **reliably inside Revit**.
